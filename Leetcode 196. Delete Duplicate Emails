Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+

SOLUTION:
(1)
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT * FROM (SELECT MIN(Id) FROM Person Group by email) temp);
(2)
DELETE P1 
FROM Person P1, Person P2
WHERE P1.Email=P2.Email AND P1.Id > P2.Id;
(3)
WITH temp AS(SELECT MIN(Id) FROM Person GROUP BY Email)
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN SELECT * FROM temp;
