SQL Schema
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

SOLUTION:
1)
SELECT Email 
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email)>1;
2)
SELECT Email
FROM (SELECT Email, COUNT(Email) AS num
      FROM Person
      GROUP BY Email) as Statistic
 WHERE num>1;
