(sale_date,fruit) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the difference between number of apples and oranges sold each day.

Return the result table ordered by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+

Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).

SOLUTION:
(1) self_join
SELECT s1.sale_date, (s1.sold_num-s2.sold_num) AS diff
FROM sales s1
LEFT JOIN sales s2
ON s1.sale_date = s2.sale_date and s1.fruit != s2.fruit
GROUP BY s1.sale_date;
(2)
SELECT a.sale_date, a.apple_num-o.orange_num AS diff
FROM(SELECT sale_date, fruit, sold_num AS apple_num FROM sales WHERE fruit='apples') a,
(SELECT sale_date, fruit, sold_num AS orange_num FROM sales WHERE fruit='oranges') o
WHERE a.sale_date = o.sale_date
GROUP BY a.sale_date;
