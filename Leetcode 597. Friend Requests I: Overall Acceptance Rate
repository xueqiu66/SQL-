SQL Schema
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept othersâ€™ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:
 

Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |
 

Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
 

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
 

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|

SOLUTION:
(1) SELECT ROUND(IF NULL(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM request_accepted) AS A)/
                        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id from friend_request) as B),0),2) 
    AS accept_rate;
    
(2) WITH a AS (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) as num_sender from friend_request),
         b AS (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) as num_accept from request_accepted)
   SELECT IFNULL(ROUND (b.num_accept/a.num_sender,2),0) AS accept_rate
   FROM a,b;
