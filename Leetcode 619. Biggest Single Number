SQL Schema
Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |

SOLUTION:
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (SELECT MAX(num) AS num FROM my_numbers GROUP BY num HAVING COUNT(num)=1)temp;


OR
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM my_numbers
WHERE num NOT IN 
(SELECT num
FROM my_numbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(num)>1);
